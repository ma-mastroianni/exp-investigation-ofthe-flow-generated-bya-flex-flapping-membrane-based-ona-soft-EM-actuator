A collection of independent MATLAB scripts as part of a significant contribution to the 2D-PIV [^2] investigation of the flapping of a smart material-based actuator in an open channel flow.<br/>
These scripts accomplish various tasks, from the data visualization of fluid flow to membrane motion measurements extracted from external software. Written in MATLAB v2021a.
